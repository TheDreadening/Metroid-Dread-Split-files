Hello and welcome to Beta testing of Metroid Dread Autosplit with Tesseract OCR / Load removal.
As of now, I am asking for volunteers to test out Arteria to Cataris elevator to test out if the images are accurate or still having issues.


This is still not 100% completed and still being tested and tweaked around. Load Removal will not be 100% perfect at this moment.
A request for a new feature was submitted, but until then, here we are. Autosplit with Tesseract OCR will read the screen for correct text and will auto split for you.
Load removal is being used with images as of now, hopefully if the new request is approved, it will make this 100% accurate.

Items you will need will be [Autosplit](https://github.com/Toufool/AutoSplit/releases/tag/v2.3.1) / Live Integration / Tesseract OCR / Dread beta files.
