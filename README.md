Welcome to Metroid Dread Auto Splitter + Load Removal.

This is still not 100% completed and still being tested and tweaked around. Load Removal will not be 100% perfect at this moment.
Autosplit with Tesseract OCR will read the screen for correct text and will auto split for you.

Splits can be changed and or updated to your own needs, these current splits are set up to only start loaded removal on trains and elevators + teleporters. This will also Auto Split on item upgrades. <br>
If you have a bigger list of splits you like to keep a track of, thats not a problem, they can be added. Only have to rename some files to fit the order.

Items you will need. <br> [Autosplit](https://github.com/Toufool/AutoSplit/releases/tag/v2.3.1) This is the main program that will take care of us with the split files <br> [Live Integration](https://github.com/Toufool/LiveSplit.AutoSplitIntegration?tab=readme-ov-file) Instructions are also on the page. <br> [Tesseract OCR](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki) Very important to remember or copy and pase the installation directory to notepad, we will need it. <br> [Dread Files](https://github.com/TheDreadening/Metroid-Dread-Split-files)
